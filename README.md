1. Logistic Regression Coefficient (coef)
Each coefficient represents the change in log-odds of the outcome (execute_trade = 1) for a one-unit increase in that feature (after preprocessing).

Sign:

Positive → increases probability of trade.

Negative → decreases probability.

Magnitude:

Larger magnitude means stronger impact (after scaling/encoding).

You can also exponentiate it (Odds Ratio = exp(coef)):

Odds Ratio > 1 → increases likelihood.

Odds Ratio < 1 → decreases likelihood.

2. Standard Error (std err)
Measures uncertainty in the coefficient estimate.

A small standard error means we are confident about that coefficient.

Large standard error means the estimate is unstable (could vary a lot if we sampled again).

3. p-Value
Tests if the coefficient is significantly different from 0.

Low p-value (typically < 0.05):

The feature is statistically significant.

The relationship between that feature and outcome is unlikely to be random.

High p-value (> 0.05):

The feature might not have meaningful impact (or might need more data).

4. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
Measures multicollinearity (how much a feature is correlated with other features).

Formula:

VIF
𝑖
=
1
1
−
𝑅
𝑖

VIF 
i
​
 = 
1−R

where 
𝑅
𝑖
2
R 
i
2
​
  is how well feature 
𝑖
i can be predicted from other features.

Interpretation:

VIF ~ 1 → no correlation with other features.

VIF > 5 → moderate correlation (check carefully).

VIF > 10 → strong multicollinearity (bad, coefficients may be unstable).

5. Explaining the Model Once We Have Results
After running the pipeline + statsmodels steps:

Look at top coefficients (sorted by abs value):

Which features most increase or decrease trade probability?

Check p-values:

Focus on significant features only (p < 0.05).

Check VIF:

If a feature has VIF > 10, consider:

Removing it.

Combining correlated features.

Use odds ratios (exp(coef)):

Easy to explain to business teams (e.g., "for every increase of 1 std dev in volume, odds of trade increase by 1.8x").
